# Transcoder training sample code

"""
This sample script can be used to train a transcoder on a model of your choice.
This code, along with the transcoder training code more generally, was largely
    adapted from an older version of Joseph Bloom's SAE training repo, the latest
    version of which can be found at https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens.
Most of the parameters given here are the same as the SAE training parameters
    listed at https://jbloomaus.github.io/SAELens/training_saes/.
Transcoder-specific parameters are marked as such in comments.
